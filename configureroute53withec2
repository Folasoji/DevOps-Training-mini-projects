CONFIGURING AWS ROUTE 53 WITH EC2 INSTANCE AS THE SOURCE
1.	Create a Hosted Zone; 
•	I logged into the AWS management console, and searched for the service Route 53.
•	Clicked on create hosted zone, I chose a domain name, chose a public hosted zone and clicked create a hosted zone.
•	These are the nameservers provide by the created hosted zone;
ns-1958.awsdns-52.co.uk.
ns-855.awsdns-42.net.
ns-277.awsdns-34.com.
ns-1379.awsdns-44.org.
2.	Configure DNS Server;
•	First, I created an EC2 instance to enable me access to a public IP of the instance.
•	In the hosted zone earlier created, I clicked on create record. I selected A-routes traffic to an IPv4address and some AWS resources. I chose simple routing and inserted the public IP of my EC2. I clicked create record.

3.	Associate DNS Records with EC2 instance;
•	I created another record CNAME.
•	I could not buy domain name on godaddy to insert my nameserver.

4.	Test was carried out with domain name and my EC2 elastic IP and it worked.

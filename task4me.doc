I logged out the existing terminal for my user: sojy
I launched and signed in ubuntu with the new user I created with username: johndoe.
I opened a new terminal and issued the command pwd which gave me /hpme/johndoe
I used ls to list all files and folder in /home/johndoe
I also used cd command to move from folders (desktop to documents)
I used cd .. command to return to /home/johndoe.
